# Project Name

After using this template, find and replace `project-name` and `Project Name` with the name you would like to use for your new project.

This template project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Generate component, service, and directive with Spectator spec templates with Angular Cli:

### Component:

Default spec: `npx ng g cs dashrized-name`  
Spec with a host: `npx ng g cs dashrized-name --withHost=true`  
Spec with a custom host: `npx ng g cs dashrized-name --withCustomHost=true`

### Service:

Default spec: `npx ng g ss dashrized-name`  
Spec for testing http data service: `npx ng g ss dashrized-name --isDataService=true`

### Directive:

`npx ng g ds dashrized-name`

You can also use `npx ng generate pipe|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.  
Use the `-- --prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://cypress.io).  
Run `npm run e2e:run` to execute the end-to-end tests headless.
